		for _, v := range g { //function is defined inside function therefore it can acess the value of the outer function : closure
			println(v)

}

// The variable g is defined in main.
// The anonymous function inside visit(g, func() {...}) does not receive g as a parameter, but it can still access it because g is in the scope of the outer function (main).
// Go "closes over" the variable g, meaning that even though the anonymous function doesnâ€™t explicitly take g as a parameter, it can still reference it.

// This works because Go remembers the environment (the variables in scope) where the anonymous function is defined.
// Since g is in the scope of main, and the anonymous function is also defined within main, the function has access to g.
