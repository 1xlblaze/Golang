Key OOP Concepts in Go:

Structs: Like classes, they represent objects with data fields.
Methods: Functions tied to a struct to represent behavior.
Encapsulation: Controlled by export rules (capitalization).
Composition over Inheritance: Embedding structs for reuse.
Polymorphism: Achieved using interfaces.
No constructors/destructors: But you can define constructor-like functions.
No inheritance: But Go encourages composition.
