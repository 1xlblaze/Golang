Arrays are of static size, size can't be changed in arrays.
Arrays elements do not need to be initialized explicitly; the zero value of the type is the initial value.
Slices are of dynamic size.  
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
    
    /*  using make -> make([]T, len, cap) */
    var s []byte
    s = make([]byte, 5, 5)
    //OR
    s := make([]byte, 5)  // both equiavlent to: s == []byte{0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
