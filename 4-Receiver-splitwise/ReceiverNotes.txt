Receiver are used to link methods with the structure
type student struct{
    name string
    roll int
    city string
}
Value receiver - The method gets a copy of the struct. Any modifications made within the method will not affect the original struct.
func (p student) getdetails() {
    fmt.Printf("Student name: %s\n "roll no %d\n  city %s\n ", p.name, p.roll, p.city);
}

Pointer receiver - The method gets a reference (pointer) to the original struct, allowing the method to modify the original struct's fields.
func (p *student) getdetails() {
    p.roll = 94;
    fmt.Printf("Student name: %s\n "roll no %d\n  city %s\n ", p.name, p.roll, p.city);
}
